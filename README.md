# Analysing the trends of COVID-19 using Python
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the trends of COVID-19 using Python. It involves collecting COVID-19 data from reliable sources, processing and analyzing the data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and visualizing the trends through graphs and charts.

## Features
- Data collection from reliable sources such as WHO, CDC, or government health departments.
- Data preprocessing to clean and format the raw data for analysis.
- Statistical analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the COVID-19 data.
- Visualization of the analysis results using graphs, charts, and maps.
- Regular updates to the analysis to track the progression of the pandemic.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)
